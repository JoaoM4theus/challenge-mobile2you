Challenge Mobile2You 

In this repository is the challenge that I made from Mobile2You.

In addition to being a challenge, I improved my knowledge of Swift and Git in it.

The challenge is to show the details of a movie using The Movie DB API. I added a few more things as a way to expand my knowledge. The biggest challenges I had was with Constraints on Storyboard haha.

My Git skills aren't fully honed yet, please skip the "master" branch.

Note: The project has my public key, if you want to use your own, just create it at https://www.themoviedb.org/ and then go to the Enum file and replace the Key =)
